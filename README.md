I am taking this course because I like to code and it seemed the most fun out of all the elective courses available that would be useful when applying for uni. I hope to get more experience/knowledge out of this course (obvi!).

Interesting game features I want to learn how to implement would be multiplayer modes. Not every game needs multiplayer obviously, however, games that can function with them, like ping pong, Genshin Impact, chess, etc. are very enjoyable when there is.
