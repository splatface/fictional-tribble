# they swim for the same amount of time at 80.5 degrees
# for 78 degrees, Gallant just doesn't swim and Goofus does for just a bit
# Gallant checks water temp first, but Goofus dives right in
# the first while loop will only run if the temp is high enough while the second loop will always run at least once
# pretest loop is first one (checks water temp before)
# posttest loop is second one (checks water temp after)
